### Basic arithmetic of Complex numbers
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

There are 3 form in which a complex number may be written:

- Base form
- Polar form
- Exponential form

Each of these forms is slightly different, we often change the form to ease up the calculations.

##### Base form

Complex number in its base form is expressed by the following:<br>
$z=a+bi$<br>
The basic arithmetic operations are defined below:<br>
$z_1+z_2=a+bi+c+di=(a+b)+(c+d)i$<br>
$z_1+z_2=a+bi-(c+di)=(a-c)+(b-d)i$<br>
$z_1\cdot z_2 = (a+bi)(c+di)=ac+adi+bci+bdi^2=(ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i$<br>
$\frac{z_1}{z_2}=\frac{a+bi}{c+di}\cdot \frac{c-di}{c-di}=\frac{ac-adi+bci-bdi^2}{c^2-d^2i^2}=\frac{ac+bd+i(bc-ad)}{c^2+d^2}=\frac{ac+bd}{c^2+d^2}+i\frac{bc-ad}{c^2+d^2}$<br>
